# Cantera Workshop & Forum

## Sunday, March 24

## Pasadena Convention Center

Cantera is an open-source suite of object-oriented software tools for problems involving kinetics,
thermodynamics, and/or transport. Among other things, it can be used to:

* Evaluate thermodynamic and transport properties of mixtures
* Compute chemical equilibrium
* Evaluate species chemical production rates
* Conduct kinetics simulations with large reaction mechanisms
* Simulate one-dimensional flames
* Conduct reaction path analysis
* Create process simulations using networks of stirred reactors
* Model non-ideal fluids

This Workshop & Forum will cover basic and advanced usage of Cantera and getting started
with Cantera development. The Workshop will be hosted by the lead developers of Cantera.

Everyone is welcome, and we especially encourage new users to attend!
Registration will be conducted through the Combustion Institute.
When you register for the conference, you will be given the option to register for the workshop as well.
There is a $45 fee to register for the workshop. This is to help offset the cost of travel and refreshments for the hosts and participants.
Any leftover funds will be used to support the development of Cantera and our community.

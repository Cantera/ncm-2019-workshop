title: Schedule and Topics

# Schedule

The workshop will run all day on Sunday, March 24, with a break for lunch. In
the morning, the topics will focus on an introduction to Cantera and conducting
canonical combustion simulations. In the afternoon, we will move on to more
advanced topics, such as reactors with heat transfer or work being done on them,
discussion of convergence in 1-D simulations, and contributing to Cantera.

Attendees are welcome to come to the morning session, the afternoon session, or
both. The registration fee covers the entire day's worth of material.

# Topics

## Morning Session - Canonical Simulations with Cantera

- Introduction
- Installing Cantera
- Converting Chemkin files to Cantera format
- Initializing a simulation and setting initial conditions
- Equilibrium calculations
- Ignition delay calculations
- Flame speed calculations

## Afternoon Session - Advanced Applications of Cantera

The topics for the afternoon session are still being determined. If you have
